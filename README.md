# AddTriangle

This is a simple example of using the Blender Python API to create an
addon. This addon consists of two parts.

- A class, which defines an operator which creates a triangle mesh and
  adds it to the current scene.
- A function which adds an item to the add mesh menu, allowing you to
  actually use the operator defined above
